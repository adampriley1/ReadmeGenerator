# README Generator 

The challenge was to build a README generator using node and Inquirer


## Description

Wrote code using Node and javascript as part of student assignment. When the user enters 'node index/js' into the terminal, they are presented with a series of questions. Once these are answered, a README file is gererated based on the answers.


Requirements:

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
